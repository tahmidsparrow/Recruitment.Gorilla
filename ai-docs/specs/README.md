# Specs

Feature specifications. Write one **before** implementing a non-trivial feature, using [../spec-template.md](../spec-template.md).

## Why
A spec captures the intent, data/API contract, and acceptance criteria so any agent can implement it consistently (and review against it afterward). It also leaves a durable record of *why* a feature is shaped the way it is.

## Convention
- One file per feature: `specs/<kebab-case-feature-name>.md`.
- Keep the `Status` field current: `Draft → Approved → Implemented`.
- When implemented, link the spec from the relevant `ai-docs/` reference doc if it changes the architecture, data model, or API surface.
